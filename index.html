        <p class="describe"> In Japan, ramen shops and ramen making are considered a culinary art and Japanese people line up for hours to try a bowl made by a master ramen chef. Some ramen restaurants are so popular, there are line-ups hours before the shop is even open.
            Ramen in Japan is also quite diverse with different kinds of broths, toppings and noodle styles as well as regional variations. Different areas, cities, and even shops have their own twist on ramen preparation and ingredients making each ramen
            experience different and unique.<br> Before getting into the details of each type of ramen, the main thing to note is the soup broth is usually made from pork, chicken, beef or fish bones that are boiled for a long time as well as a seasoning
            that is mixed in with it to create a distinct taste. <br> The type of noodles used in ramen are made with flour and a salty alkaline liquid called kansui. It is kansui mixed in with other ingredients and the flour that is central to the creation
            and classification of ramen. <br>You will notice that some soup broths are very thin and clear while others are cloudy and thick. As well, the variety of noodles from thick to thin, straight to curly are all different forms of the ramen noodle.
            The color, texture, flavor and look of a bowl of ramen can be quite different yet still fall into the ramen category as long as both noodles and soup broth follow the ramen rules.

        <p class="describe"> Sushi (すし, 寿司) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its
            presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).<br>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
            It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled
            daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.<br>Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.

        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/S8Qc4QddwrLKSRLFA"> 〒350-0043 Saitama, Kawagoe, Shintomicho, 2 Chome-10-7</a>
        <p class="describe"> Taiyaki (鯛焼き, lit. 'baked sea bream') is a Japanese fish-shaped cake, commonly sold as street food. It imitates the shape of tai (鯛 red seabream), which it is named after. The most common filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened azuki
            beans. Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage inside. Smaller, differently shaped versions called kingyoyaki (金魚焼き, lit. 'baked goldfish')
            are also available and often sold in bags of five, ten, or more.<br>Taiyaki are similar to imagawayaki, which are thick round cakes also filled with sweet azuki bean paste or custard.
